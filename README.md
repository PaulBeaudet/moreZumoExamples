This is just to give further examples as to what can be done with the Zumo Shield by Pololu

Sketch is meant to sumo on a white ring with black boarders
as opposed to traditional black to white

The comments included are geared to people being introduced to programing

Features in working or in progress*:

Detect Boarders and react and turn around
drive whilst playing tunes
Sequence events with time checking instead of delays
Calibratining compass reading into EEPROM
Store melody in program memory to avoid RAM overuse
Calibrating motors with compass heading*
Map an arena patern*
Detect collisions*
use external sensors*
varify intention fufulment with accelerometer*

Without looking I'm going to say this code is licenced as Pololu licenced their library which I
believe is BSD.
