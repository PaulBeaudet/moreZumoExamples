#Further examples for the Zumo Shield by Pololu#

This sketch is meant to sumo on a white ring with black boarders
as opposed to traditional black to white

The comments included are geared to people being introduced to programing

##Features in working or in progress:##

* Detect Boarders and react and turn around
* drive whilst playing tunes
* Sequence events with time checking instead of delays
* Calibratining compass reading into EEPROM
* Store melody in program memory to avoid RAM overuse
* Calibrating motors with compass heading
* Map an arena patern
* Detect collisions
* use external sensors
* varify intention fufulment with accelerometer

*Without looking I'm going to say this code is licenced as Pololu licenced their library *
*which I believe is BSD.*
