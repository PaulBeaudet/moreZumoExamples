#Testing: Zumo Shield by Pololu#

This sketch is meant to sumo on a white ring with black boarders
as opposed to traditional black to white. This is easily changed by reversing a wakka wakka (<,>) and adjusting "LIGHT_SENSITIVITY" higher in the reflectence tab.

The comments included are geared to people being introduced to programing

##Features: working or in progress(*):##

* Detect Boarders and react and turn around
* drive whilst playing tunes 
* Tune -Mario Theme, Nyan cat would be nice if someone could help plot out the sheet music
* Sequence sensor and motor events with time checking instead of delays
* Calibratining compass readings into EEPROM
* Store melody in program memory to avoid RAM overuse
* detect when being picked up
* Calibrated motors with compass heading*
* Map an arena patern for speed awareness* 
* Detect collisions with accelerometer*
* use external sensors*
* varify intention fufulment with accelerometer*
* define turn degrees with compass*
* timed button debounce fuction with release detection
* four state user control (4 mode button cycle)

*Without looking I'm going to say this code is licenced as Pololu licenced their library
which I believe is BSD.*
